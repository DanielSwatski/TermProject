# TermProject
This is the Term Project for CIS3342 @ Temple University

This was written for the Spring 2023 semester building upon all the knowledge learned in the course.

This project is a clone of Zillow using ASP.NET Webforms and WebAPIs. 

In the implementation of the project, users can create accounts as a home buyer or home seller. Our database encrypts user passwords and allows for account recovery if a user losers their password. 

Buyers can view many different types of homes based upon certain search criteria listed. When they find their dream home, they can select and view a more detailed page of the home including seller info, photos of rooms, and comments upon the home. Buyers can also schedule a showing and make an offer on this page. 

Sellers can list homes and select buyers based upon bids offered. They can also add details about their rooms for the whole world to see.

To store our photos in our database, we serialized each jpg.
